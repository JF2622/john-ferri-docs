This file will be expanded in an upcoming revision. Tier 1 SOC Onboarding SOP for Tooling and Access Owner: SOC Lead / Operations Last Updated: 2026-01-15 Audience: New Tier 1 Analysts and SOC Interns Purpose: This SOP details the step-by-step process to provision access and confirm readiness for Tier 1 SOC analysts to begin monitoring and triage on Day 1. Audience: Tier 1 SOC Analysts (New Hires) SOC Team Leads who onboard analysts IT and Identity administrators supporting access requests Prerequisites: Access and accounts Before Day 1, confirm the following are completed: The corporate SSO account was created and you can sign in successfully. MFA was enrolled and is working on your approved device. You have been added to the appropriate RBAC group(s) for \u201cSOC Tier 1\u201d (or equivalent). VPN access was approved (if you are remote or hybrid) and you can connect without errors. The ticketing system access was provisioned with create, view, and comment permissions. The monitoring platform access is provisioned (read-only access is sufficient for Day 1). You have access to the SOC communication channel and the escalation contact list. Workstation and Connectivity The company-managed workstation has been issued and you can log in locally. The required browsers are installed and up to date. You can reach required internal resources, such as the Intranet and the documentation portal while you are on the office network or the approved VPN. Your time has been synchronized, with an accurate system clock, to prevent authentication and log-correlation issues. Day 1 Checklist: Confirm SSO login and MFA enrollment. Verification: Successfully sign into the corporate portal twice without being locked out. Confirm VPN Access and network reachability. Verification: Connect to the VPN and reach internal resources, such as the Intranet homepage. Request and confirm SOC group membership (Tier 1 role). Verification: The identity portal should show group membership or your manager should confirm your approval. Access the ticketing system and confirm you can view assigned queues. Verification: Ensure that you can open a ticket and add a comment. Access the monitoring platform and confirm read-only visibility. Verification: Ensure you can view dashboards and search logs. Complete a baseline \"first alert\" walkthrough with your lead. Verification: Ensure you can document one test alert triage in a practice ticket/template. Verify escalation contacts and communication channels. Verification: Ensure you can access SOC channels and that you have the escalation list. Document the completion of this process in an onboarding checklist. Verification: Confirm that the checklist is marked complete and that your manager acknowledges it. Escalation Criteria (Tier 1 \u2192 Tier 2/Lead) Escalate when any of the following are true: High Potential Impact: privileged accounts, production systems, large user populations, or regulated data Credible Signs of Compromise: valid IOC match, repeated failed logins followed by success, impossible travel, or suspicious MFA behavior Persistence or Spread: repeated alerts for the same entity in a short time window, or multiple related alerts across hosts/users Unable to Verify Benign Cause Quickly: after reasonable triage (e.g., 15\u201330 minutes), you still cannot explain the activity Policy Requires Escalation: severity threshold met, VIP/executive account involved, or \u201cmust escalate\u201d playbook category What to Include in the Escalation Note: Alert name/type, timestamp range, and impacted user/host What you observed (2\u20135 bullets) What you already checked (logs queried, tickets referenced, change windows) Your current assessment (suspected false/true positive and confidence level) Recommended next action (containment request, deeper investigation, contact system owner) Troubleshooting: Symptom Likely Cause Quick Fix / Next Step Escalate To Unable to log in to SSO (invalid password or account locked) Password not set, account not activated, lockout from multiple attempts Use password reset process; wait for lockout timer if applicable; retry once IT Service Desk / IAM MFA fails (codes rejected, prompts not arriving) Wrong time on device, enrollment incomplete, incorrect method selected Verify device time sync; re-enroll MFA method; try backup method if available IT Service Desk / IAM VPN connects but internal sites/tools don\u2019t load Split-tunnel policy, DNS issue, wrong VPN profile Disconnect/reconnect; verify correct profile; flush DNS and retry Network Support / IT \u201cAccess denied\u201d to monitoring platform or empty dashboards RBAC group not assigned, permission propagation delay Confirm you\u2019re in the SOC Tier 1 group; wait 15\u201330 minutes after approval; retry SOC Lead / IAM Can\u2019t view or update ticket queue Wrong project/queue permissions Confirm assigned queue/project; request correct role; test by commenting on a sample ticket SOC Lead / Ticketing Admin Glossary: SOC - Security Operations Center: This is a central location that uses a team of people, a set of processes, and an array of technological tools to continuously monitor, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents and threats. It assists in improving an organization's overall security posture. SIEM - Security Information and Event Management system: This is a cybersecurity solution that collects large amounts of data and analyzes activity from a wide array of devices, servers, and users across an organization, consolidating this information into one unified platform that grants an organization a comprehensive view of their cybersecurity posture. A SIEM helps a SOC with quickly and successfully detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents. Alert: A real-time notification from a security tool, such as a SIEM, that signals that there is suspicious activity or a possible threat (examples: malware, unauthorized logins, policy violations) that must be investigated to verify whether it is an actual security incident or noise. Triage: This is an important process early on in the cyber incident response process, in which personnel and security tools will analyze, classify, and prioritize incoming security alerts and incidents to separate real threats from noise and allow resources to be concentrated on the most urgent events, similar to emergency medicine. False Positive: This is a false alarm, also called noise, when an alert is generated by a security tool, such as a SIEM, incorrectly flagging normal activity as a threat or vulnerability. False Negative: This is when a security system, such as a SIEM, fails to detect a threat, attacker, or vulnerability, instead labeling the activity as in question as normal. This allows malicious activity to continue without detection, potentially causing damage. True Positive: This is a situation in which a security tool, such as a SIEM, correctly identifies a security threat or malicious activity, triggering an alert for a SOC analyst to investigate. True Negative: This is a situation in which a security tool, such as a SIEM, correctly determines that there is currently no malicious activity, vulnerability, attack, or threat. No alert is generated, and normal activity can continue without issue. IOC - Indicator of Compromise: This is a clue that there is a past or ongoing security breach. This clue can take many forms, ranging from a suspicious IP to a strange file hash or unexpected network traffic. An IOC can help analysts detect malware, unauthorized access, or data theft. Escalation: This is the formal process of moving a cybersecurity alert or incident from a response by a lower-tier analyst (Tier 1, for example) to a more specialized team (such as an incident response team or a management team), when the situation exceeds the abilities of the initial responders, requires deeper investigation, or becomes a major business risk. There is often an escalation matrix to manage this process, delineating clear roles, triggers, and timelines. Playbook: A playbook is a step-by-step, detailed guide or automated workflow that allows for consistent, efficient responses to certain kinds of cybersecurity threats. A playbook defines who does what, when, and with which tools, helping to detect, analyze, contain, and remediate cyber incidents. RBAC - Role-Based Access Control: This is when access permissions are assigned to job roles instead of individuals. This ensures that analysts will only access tools and data that are needed for their job, helping to enforce the principle of least privilege, reduce risk, simplify management, and improve compliance. MFA - Multi-Factor Authentication: This is a layered form of cyber defense that requires users to provide two or more different types of verification methods, such as a password and a code from an authenticator app or a text message, to prove their identity. MFA can reduce the risk of unauthorized access, even when passwords are stolen.","title":"SOP"},{"location":"sop-tier1-soc-onboarding/#tier-1-soc-onboarding-sop-for-tooling-and-access","text":"Owner: SOC Lead / Operations Last Updated: 2026-01-15 Audience: New Tier 1 Analysts and SOC Interns","title":"Tier 1 SOC Onboarding SOP for Tooling and Access"},{"location":"sop-tier1-soc-onboarding/#purpose","text":"This SOP details the step-by-step process to provision access and confirm readiness for Tier 1 SOC analysts to begin monitoring and triage on Day 1.

Assessment (TP/FP + confidence): FP (high). Geo discrepancy consistent with VPN egress routing. Action Taken / Next Step: Closed as FP. Added note to tune rule to recognize VPN egress ranges if supported. Example 1B \u2014 Suspicious Login (Escalate) Alert / Report: Impossible travel / concurrent sessions User / Host: jdoe@example.com Time Range: 2026-01-26 02:10\u201302:25 ET Source IP / Geo: 203.0.113.88 (Berlin, DE) and 198.51.100.77 (Chicago, IL) within 6 minutes Device / User Agent: New user agent observed; device not previously seen What I Checked: - IdP sign-in logs (successes/failures, MFA results) - Session/concurrent sign-in indicators - Recent password reset or access request tickets - Privilege level / group membership Findings (facts): - Successful sign-in from unfamiliar geo/device preceded by multiple failed attempts. - MFA challenges observed; outcome unclear (mixed denies/timeouts). - Concurrent activity from two distant geos within minutes. - No travel/exception record found in tickets. Assessment (TP/FP + confidence): Suspected TP (medium-high). Pattern consistent with credential compromise attempts. Action Taken / Next Step: Prepared escalation with evidence summary and recommended containment. Escalation (if any): Escalated to Tier 2/Lead per SOP Escalation Criteria. Recommended: revoke sessions/refresh tokens, force password reset, review conditional access for geo/device. Example 2A \u2014 MFA Fatigue (Attempted Compromise; user denied prompts) Alert / Report: User report: repeated MFA prompts not initiated User / Host: jsmith@example.com Time Range: 2026-01-26 18:40\u201319:05 ET Source IP / Geo: 192.0.2.44 (unknown ISP, out-of-state) Device / User Agent: New device; mobile push prompts What I Checked: - IdP sign-in/MFA challenge events (counts and outcomes) - Source IP reputation/internal allowlists - Concurrent sign-ins and follow-on success events - Privilege level (admin/VIP) indicators Findings (facts): - 17 MFA push prompts generated in 25 minutes. - User reports denying/ignoring prompts; no explicit approval reported. - Multiple failed sign-in attempts; no confirmed successful sign-in observed. - Source IP not in known corporate/VPN egress list. Assessment (TP/FP + confidence): Likely attempted compromise (medium). Push fatigue pattern present; success not confirmed. Action Taken / Next Step: Escalated with evidence and recommended protective steps. Escalation (if any): Escalated to Tier 2/Lead. Recommended: password reset, enforce phishing-resistant MFA if available, block source IP/geo if policy allows, monitor for follow-on attempts. Example 2B \u2014 MFA Fatigue (High-confidence compromise; user approved prompt) Alert / Report: User report: approved an MFA prompt by mistake User / Host: jsmith@example.com Time Range: 2026-01-26 09:10\u201309:25 ET Source IP / Geo: 203.0.113.19 (unfamiliar geo) Device / User Agent: New device; browser sign-in What I Checked: - IdP sign-in logs for successful sign-in and session creation - MFA outcomes and device registration changes - Any mailbox/email rule creation indicators (if applicable) - Privilege level and access scope Findings (facts): - User approved an unexpected MFA prompt. - Successful sign-in recorded from unfamiliar IP/geo immediately after approval. - New session established; additional access attempts observed shortly after. - No change window or travel exception documented. Assessment (TP/FP + confidence): High-confidence compromise risk (high). Action Taken / Next Step: Immediate escalation and containment recommendation. Escalation (if any): Escalated to Tier 2/Lead. Recommended: revoke sessions, force password reset, re-register MFA, check for persistence (rules/forwarding), and evaluate account disable per policy.","title":"Ticket Note Examples"},{"location":"ticket-note-examples/#ticket-note-examples-tier-1-soc","text":"","title":"Ticket Note Examples (Tier 1 SOC)"},{"location":"ticket-note-examples/#purpose","text":"Provide copy/paste-ready examples of Tier 1 investigation notes that are clear, repeatable, and escalation-ready.","title":"Purpose"},{"location":"ticket-note-examples/#standard-fields","text":"Alert / Report: User / Host: Time Range: Source IP / Geo: Device / User Agent: What I Checked: - - Findings (facts): - - Assessment (TP/FP + confidence): Action Taken / Next Step: Escalation (if any):","title":"Standard Fields"},{"location":"ticket-note-examples/#example-1a-suspicious-login-likely-false-positive","text":"Alert / Report: Impossible travel / risky sign-in User / Host: jdoe@example.com Time Range: 2026-01-26 13:05\u201313:20 ET Source IP / Geo: 198.51.100.10 (Ashburn, VA) \u2192 203.0.113.22 (New York, NY) Device / User Agent: Known device ID present; Chrome on Windows 11 What I Checked: - IdP sign-in logs for the user (same time window) - MFA outcomes and device context - Ticket system for travel/remote work notes - Known corporate/VPN egress IP list Findings (facts): - Both sign-ins originated from known corporate/VPN egress ranges. - MFA was completed successfully using the user\u2019s registered method. - Device context matches historical logins (known device; no new device registration). - No additional anomalous sign-ins observed in \u00b12 hours.
