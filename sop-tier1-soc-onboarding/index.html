</ol>
<h2 id="escalation-criteria-tier-1-tier-2lead">Escalation Criteria (Tier 1 → Tier 2/Lead)</h2>
<p>Escalate when any of the following are true:</p>

<li><strong>Unable to Verify Benign Cause Quickly:</strong> after reasonable triage (e.g., 15–30 minutes), you still cannot explain the activity</li>
<li><strong>Policy Requires Escalation:</strong> severity threshold met, VIP/executive account involved, or “must escalate” playbook category</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-include-in-the-escalation-note">What to Include in the Escalation Note:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alert name/type, timestamp range, and impacted user/host</li>
<li>What you observed (2–5 bullets)</li>
<li>What you already checked (logs queried, tickets referenced, change windows)</li>
<li>Your current assessment (suspected false/true positive and confidence level)</li>
<li>Recommended next action (containment request, deeper investigation, contact system owner)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SOC - Security Operations Center:</strong>
This is a central location that uses a team of people, a set of processes, and an array of technological tools to continuously monitor, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents and threats. It assists in improving an organization's overall security posture. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SIEM - Security Information and Event Management system:</strong> 
This is a cybersecurity solution that collects large amounts of data and analyzes activity from a wide array of devices, servers, and users across an organization, consolidating this information into one unified platform that grants an organization a comprehensive view of their cybersecurity posture. A SIEM helps a SOC with quickly and successfully detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alert:</strong> A real-time notification from a security tool, such as a SIEM, that signals that there is suspicious activity or a possible threat (examples: malware, unauthorized logins, policy violations) that must be investigated to verify whether it is an actual security incident or noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Triage:</strong> This is an important process early on in the cyber incident response process, in which personnel and security tools will analyze, classify, and prioritize incoming security alerts and incidents to separate real threats from noise and allow resources to be concentrated on the most urgent events, similar to emergency medicine.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>False Positive:</strong> This is a false alarm, also called noise, when an alert is generated by a security tool, such as a SIEM, incorrectly flagging normal activity as a threat or vulnerability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>False Negative:</strong> This is when a security system, such as a SIEM, fails to detect a threat, attacker, or vulnerability, instead labeling the activity as in question as normal. This allows malicious activity to continue without detection, potentially causing damage. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>True Positive:</strong> This is a situation in which a security tool, such as a SIEM, correctly identifies a security threat or malicious activity, triggering an alert for a SOC analyst to investigate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>True Negative:</strong> This is a situation in which a security tool, such as a SIEM, correctly determines that there is currently no malicious activity, vulnerability, attack, or threat. No alert is generated, and normal activity can continue without issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IOC - Indicator of Compromise:</strong>
This is a clue that there is a past or ongoing security breach. This clue can take many forms, ranging from a suspicious IP to a strange file hash or unexpected network traffic. An IOC can help analysts detect malware, unauthorized access, or data theft. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Escalation:</strong> This is the formal process of moving a cybersecurity alert or incident from a response by a lower-tier analyst (Tier 1, for example) to a more specialized team (such as an incident response team or a management team), when the situation exceeds the abilities of the initial responders, requires deeper investigation, or becomes a major business risk. There is often an escalation matrix to manage this process, delineating clear roles, triggers, and timelines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Playbook:</strong> A playbook is a step-by-step, detailed guide or automated workflow that allows for consistent, efficient responses to certain kinds of cybersecurity threats. A playbook defines who does what, when, and with which tools, helping to detect, analyze, contain, and remediate cyber incidents. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RBAC - Role-Based Access Control:</strong> 
This is when access permissions are assigned to job roles instead of individuals. This ensures that analysts will only access tools and data that are needed for their job, helping to enforce the principle of least privilege, reduce risk, simplify management, and improve compliance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MFA - Multi-Factor Authentication:</strong> 
This is a layered form of cyber defense that requires users to provide two or more different types of verification methods, such as a password and a code from an authenticator app or a text message, to prove their identity. MFA can reduce the risk of unauthorized access, even when passwords are stolen. </p>
